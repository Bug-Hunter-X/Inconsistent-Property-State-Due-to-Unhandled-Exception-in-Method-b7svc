# Inconsistent Property State Due to Unhandled Exception

This example demonstrates a subtle bug in C# where an exception within a method could leave a class property in an inconsistent state. The `MyProperty` setter relies on the `_myField` backing field to maintain its value. If an exception occurs within `MyMethod`, the setter might not be executed, leading to an unexpected value for `MyProperty`.

**Bug:** The `MyMethod` doesn't handle exceptions. If an exception occurs within `MyMethod`, the `_myField` may not be updated consistently with the `MyProperty` value. 

**Solution:** Implement proper exception handling within the `MyMethod` to prevent this inconsistency.  Either handle the exception or propagate it appropriately and consider using a try-catch-finally block to ensure state consistency even if exceptions occur.
